# DragAndDrop

Hello everyone!

This is my final project in IOS class.

I made a Kanban board for help people to handle there missions instead of to do list.

I hope you enjoy the project.

**P.S**

*After download the app you need to do 'pod install'*

**Comment to guy**

I add photos of the app in PhotoApp folder and video clips of the app in Media folder.

Hope you enjoy.

Thanks.
